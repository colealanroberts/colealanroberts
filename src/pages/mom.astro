          <p>Dear Mom,</p>
          <p>I still remember when you helped buy my first MacBook.</p>
          <p>I had wanted to build iPhone games — while I never built any games, that computer allowed me to pursue graphic design and eventually programming. I can't thank you enough for believing in me all those years ago.</p>
          <p>As a token of my appreciation and love for you, here's my way of saying thank you.</p>
          <p>Love,<br>Cole</p>
