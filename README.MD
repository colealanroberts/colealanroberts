# Hi there,
I'm a former Product Designer turned iOS Engineer living in Dallas, TX.

### Development
- Working on [LIKEtoKNOW.it](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/liketoknow-it/id1154027990) for iOS.
- Hacking on [Fuze](https://www.getfuze.app). This needs some TLC as we're fixing up some of the signing issues.

### About
- I enjoy sketching using Procreate, reading, exercising, and playing PC games, in no particular order.

### Contact
Please feel free to reach out to me by email!
